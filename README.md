# Netflix_data_mining
In this project we are going to explore a dataset that contains Movies/TV Series that are available in the popular streaming platform "Netflix".

In the first part of this project we're going to visualize some data based on a number of queries that are available below. In the second part we will try to extract useful information from the movies' descriptions in order to build a recommendation system.
